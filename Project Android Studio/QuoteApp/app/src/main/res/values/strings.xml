    <string name="sample_quote">"We'll live through the long, long days, and through the long nights. We'll patiently endure the trials that fate sends our way. Even if we can't rest, we'll continue to work for others both now and when we have grown old. And when our last hour comes we'll go quietly. And in the great beyond, we'll say to Him that we suffered, that we cried, that life was hard. And God will have pity on us. Then you and I we'll see that bright, wonderful, dreamlike life before our eyes. We shall rejoice, and with tender smiles on our faces, we'll look back on our current sorrow. And then at last, we shall rest. I believe it. I strongly believe it from the bottom of my heart. When that time comes, we shall rest."</string>
